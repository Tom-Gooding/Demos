## Dissertation
My dissertation titled, "Overtraining through a new lens: Characterization of overreach in reacreationally active adults and the hormetic complications" was written during my doctorate in Nutrition & Exercise Physiology (Washington State University '24). Accordingly, the body of my dissertation consists of three chapters which are intended to become standalone manuscripts.

The overarching purpose of this dissertation was to test the hypothesis that individuals other than high-level athletes can experience a maladaptive training response known as overtraining—a condition where performance and health decline as a result of excessive exercise training loads and inadequate recovery. In the introduction and concluding sections (Chapters I and V, respectively), I make the case that overtraining is the upper-limit of exercise-induced hormesis. Hormesis is a biological phenomena where a dose-response follows a J-shaped curve whereby both low and high doses of a stimulus return a similar response on a system. In the case of exercise, both low levels (e.g., physical inactivity) and high levels (excessive exercise) produce adverse health outcomes.

## ATLAS.ti Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
During my work with the Occupational Sleep Medicine Group (OSMG) at Washington State University, I became part of a research group (called TriSafe) aimed at understanding the underlying risk factors of cardiac emergencies during Ironman triathlon events. As a part of this team, I conducted a series of focus groups and interviews of athletes to determine their perceptions on injury risk factors, injury prevention strategies, and mental health concerns during training and competition. This qualitative research study was conducted primarily through the software program ATLAS.ti to review textual data (transcripts), apply codes to the data, and ultimately generate meaningful insights through latent content analysis.

Accordingly, I created this SOP document to inform other members of the OSMG lab, and other members on the TriSafe research team, on how to use ATLAS.ti—including personal tips and major pitfalls to avoid.
