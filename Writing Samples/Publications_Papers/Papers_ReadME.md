## Dissertation*
My dissertation titled, "Overtraining through a new lens: Characterization of overreach in reacreationally active adults and the hormetic complications" was written during my doctorate in Nutrition & Exercise Physiology (Washington State University '24). Accordingly, the body of my dissertation consists of three chapters which are intended to become standalone manuscripts.

The overarching purpose of this dissertation was to test the hypothesis that individuals other than high-level athletes can experience a maladaptive training response known as overtraining—a condition where performance and health decline as a result of excessive exercise training loads and inadequate recovery. In the introduction and concluding sections (Chapters I and V, respectively), I make the case that overtraining is the upper-limit of exercise-induced hormesis. Hormesis is a biological phenomena where a dose-response follows a J-shaped curve whereby both low and high doses of a stimulus return a similar response on a system. In the case of exercise, both low levels (e.g., physical inactivity) and high levels (excessive exercise) produce adverse health outcomes.

## ATLAS.ti Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
During my work with the Occupational Sleep Medicine Group (OSMG) at Washington State University, I became part of a research group (called TriSafe) aimed at understanding the underlying risk factors of cardiac emergencies during Ironman triathlon events. As a part of this team, I conducted a series of focus groups and interviews of athletes to determine their perceptions on injury risk factors, injury prevention strategies, and mental health concerns during training and competition. This qualitative research study was conducted primarily through the software program ATLAS.ti to review textual data (transcripts), apply codes to the data, and ultimately generate meaningful insights through latent content analysis.

Accordingly, I created this SOP document to inform other members of the OSMG lab, and other members on the TriSafe research team, on how to use ATLAS.ti—including personal tips and major pitfalls to avoid.

## Clinical Pearl of Practice- Voodoo floss bands*. 
A clinical pearl can be defined as "a concise, practical piece of medical advice or insight that is based on clinical experience and observation." In other words, clinical pearls are tips & tricks that clinical medical professional rely on that have proven to be effective for certain scenarios, but lack rigorous peer-reviewed evidence. Voodoo flossing is a technique I learned from Dr. Kelly Starrett's book [*Becoming a Supple Leopard*](https://thereadystate.com/product/becoming-a-supple-leopard-2nd-edition/) which I used as a clinical athletic trainer to treat joint-related issues—primarily at the knee, elbow, and ankle. Accordingly, I wrote this paper to describe the Voodoo 'flossing' technique in clinical terms and to attempt to explain the theoretical physiological principles for how Voodoo flossing might be used to treat elbow epicondylitis.

**Bottom line:** Voodoo flossing at the elbow promotes induces ischemia and compression forces to breakup myofascial adhesions and, upon cessation, promotes a 'rebound' effect of increased blood flow to the site of inflammation including oxygen, nutrients, and chemical mediators to promote tissue healing. 

## Intrinsic Foot Muscle Activation During Specific Exercises- A T2 Time Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study*
This paper was written while earning my Master's in Athletic Training (University of Virginia '2015). The intrinsic foot muscles include several small muscles whose orgin and insertions are all housed in the foot (e.g., flexor hallucis brevis), as opposed to extrinsic foot muscles whose origins begin on the lower leg and insert on the foot (e.g., anterior tibialis). 
**Background:** In sports medicine, therapeutic exercises are often prescribed to target the intrinsic foot muscles (e.g., towel curls or picking up marbles with the toes); however, these movement patterns actually involve the extrinsic foot muscles. Electromyography (EMG) is a common technique used to assess the degree muscle activation either via surface EMG (electrodes on skin over select musculature) or through intramuscular EMG (electrode needles placed within the muscle(s) being observed). However, surface EMG is no ideal when trying to isolate smaller, close-packed muscles (i.e., the intrinsic foot muscles) as there is a consierable risk of 'cross-talk' or signal interference in the EMG. Similarly, intramuscular EMG is not ideal for small, close-packed muscles (without visual guidance) as it is difficult to verify that your electrode placement is in the desired muscle. Hence, **the purpose of this study was to assess intrinsic foot muscle activation from therapeutic exercises through the novel use of T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).** In this study, I had participants perform 4 different exercises (short foot exercise, toe spread out exercise, 1st toe extension 2-5th toe extension) used in sports medicine which are specifically meant to target the intrinsic foot muscles. T2 MRI of the feet were performed pre- and post- exercise and percent increase in activation was calculated using the WinVessel software package (v.2.011).

**Results:** All intrinsic foot muscles showed increased activation after all four exercises with muscle activity ranging from 16.7% to 34.9% (shot-foot exercise), 17.3% to 35.2% (toes spread out), 13.1% to 18.1% (first-toe extension), and 8.9% to 22.5% (second- to fifth-toes extension). 

**Conclusion:** Each of the four exercises included in this study resulted in increasing intrinsic foot muscle activity, suggesting their effectiveness in therapeutic exercise prescription.
