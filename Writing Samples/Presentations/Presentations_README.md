# Presentations Overview
Brief descriptions of each presentation included within this file. **Note:** Presentations with an asterisk* have companion writing samples in the [Publications_Papers](https://github.com/Tom-Gooding/Portfolio/tree/c68a201f057b2b29547fd91cf56a16124f37b0da/Writing%20Samples/Publications_Papers) folder. 

## Dissertation Defense
This is the presentation I used to defend my dissertation. The presentation covers topics related to physical activity levels (i.e., dose-response relationship), hormesis theory, overtraining, sleep, immune function, and proteomics. The visuals I created were made using Python (Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries) and the [STRING database](https://string-db.org/) (for proteomics string networks). 
The dissertation itself includes 5 chapters, with chapters 2â€“4 meant to serve as standalone manuscripts covering physiological responses to high-intensity training to determine overtraining status (chapter 2), sleep measures (chapter 3), and proteomics (chapter 4). Chapters 1 and 5 work to serve as a unifying theme of the dissertation in which I discuss previous mechanistic theories of overtraining and argue that overtraining is the upper-limit of exercise-induced hormesis.
