# Presentations Overview
Brief descriptions of each presentation included within this file. **Note:** Presentations with an asterisk* have companion writing samples in the [Publications_Papers](https://github.com/Tom-Gooding/Portfolio/tree/c68a201f057b2b29547fd91cf56a16124f37b0da/Writing%20Samples/Publications_Papers) folder. 

## Dissertation Defense
This is the presentation I used to defend my dissertation. The presentation covers topics related to physical activity levels (i.e., dose-response relationship), hormesis theory, overtraining, sleep, immune function, and proteomics. The visuals I created were made using Python (Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries) and the [STRING database](https://string-db.org/) (for proteomics string networks). 
The dissertation itself includes 5 chapters, with chapters 2â€“4 meant to serve as standalone manuscripts covering physiological responses to high-intensity training to determine overtraining status (chapter 2), sleep measures (chapter 3), and proteomics (chapter 4). Chapters 1 and 5 work to serve as a unifying theme of the dissertation in which I discuss previous mechanistic theories of overtraining and argue that overtraining is the upper-limit of exercise-induced hormesis.

- **Chapter 1: General Introduction**
- **Chapter 2: Recreationally active adults exhibit symptoms of overtraining following a three-week lab-controlled overreaching training protocol**
    - Variables: cycling performance, maximum heart rate, heart rate recovery, peak aerobic capacity, peak lactate, and profile of mood states
- **Chapter 3: Sleep patterns of recreationally active adults throughout a three-week high-intensity overreaching training protocol**
    - Variables: total sleep time, cumulative sleep debt, self-reported sleepiness, self-reported fatigue, upper-respiratory illness symptoms
- **Chapter 4: Immune-related proteome responses in recreationally active adults following a three-week overreaching training protocol: A pilot investigation**
    - Variables: upregulated proteins (log2 fold change) post-training and post-recovery, acute-phase immune system proteins in STRING network.  
- **Chapter 5: General discussion**

## Overtraining ACSM Poster 2023
This is a poster presentation I presented at the 2023 American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Symposium held in Denver, CO. The information presented included the overall study design of my dissertation and preliminary results of my dissertation research demonstrating that recreationally active adults could exhibit symptoms of overtraining following high-intensity exercise.

## Rapid Fire Case Study Presentation NATA 
As a clinical athletic trainer (ATC), I treated an athlete for neck pain which turned out to be stage III-IV thyroid cancer. I wrote a case report about this clinical manifestation and this is the oral presentation of this case I gave at the National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA) Symposium. 

## SLEEP 2025 Poster
This is a poster presentation I presented at the 2025 SLEEP conference (Seattle, WA) covering how high-intensity training impacts sleep measures, including sleep regularity. Taking inspiration from [Better Posters](https://betterposters.blogspot.com/) my poster was intended to let passersby read the key takeaways at a glance, in addition to me standing near the poster and having more in-depth conversations about the study with conference attendees.
