# Overview of Python Script, key visuals, and findings

Code in this project relates to sleep data I collected and analyzed during my PhD and postdoctoral fellowship in occupational sleep medicine. Accordingly, the full study design, methodology, results, and interpretation of this dataset can be found in the [dissertation](https://github.com/Tom-Gooding/Portfolio/blob/d0773e6922e7b010776dfe9ba50723a2cc096ba8/Writing%20Samples/Publications_Papers/Gooding%20Full%20Dissertation.pdf) document of my written samples portfolio. However, level 2 headings below will direct you to each Jupyter Notebook with a description of what actions each Jupyter Notebook performs, Python libraries used, data analytics skills demonstrated, and includes sample figures/statistics generated within each Notebook.

## sleep_data_visuals_101025
This Jupyter notebook was used to generate figures for a conference poster presentation and for a journal manuscript (currently underreview) regarding sleep measures during high-intensity training. A group of recreationally active adults (TR group, n=11) underwent three weeks of exercise training and weekly exercise testing and were compared to a control group (CON, n=9). Sleep was measured daily using wrist-worn actigraphy and sleep devices. Illness symptoms were assessed using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Screening Survey (WURSS-11). After training, the TR group was monitored for a 3-week recovery phase. TR participants were divided into overreached (OR, n=3) or adapted (n=8) subgroups, if exercise testing performance decreased beyond a certain threshold (data not shown in this notebook). Accordingly, visuals and statistics were used to assess sleep differences between two (CON, TR) and three-groups (CON, AD, OR).

**Libraries used:** Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pingouin, datetime (datetime, timedelta), SciPy.
**Skills demonstrated:** Data cleaning, data visualization, descriptive Statistics, exploratory statistical analysis. 
**Visuals Generated:**
