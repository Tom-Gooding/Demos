## Overview:
I am following Alex the Analyst's (AA) YouTube series for getting practical hands on experience with SQL. I've been using postresql over the past few months and am looking to build my confidence in moving through SQL, Python (already learned), and excel using a combination of Github and VS Code for future Data analyst/scientist roles. 


## Notes for pull/push commands from/to Github:

- cd Desktop/Git_mats/Demos
- git clone "repository hyperlink here"  
(If it hasn't been cloned before)

Otherwise:
  - git pull origin main.
  - git checkout -b "branch-name"  
  or
  - git checkout "branch-name" (if previously created")  
or
- git checkout origin "branch-name"

Then:

- work on project using VS Code. 

Then, when ready to save progress and push the branch back into Github:

- git status (see what changes were made to docs)
- git add . (stages all changes)  
or
- git add "file-name" (stages changes only made to specific document)

Then:
- git commit -m "message of what actions were performed"  

Then:
- git push origin "branch name" (to push the branch)  
or
- git push origin or git push origin main (will push updates directly into main branch.)...not advised and should instead push branch and then approve changes upon review.
