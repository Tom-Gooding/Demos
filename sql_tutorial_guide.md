## Overview:
I am following Alex the Analyst's (AA) YouTube series for getting practical hands on experience with SQL. I've been using postresql over the past few months and am looking to build my confidence in moving through SQL, Python (already learned), and excel using a combination of Github and VS Code for future Data analyst/scientist roles.
